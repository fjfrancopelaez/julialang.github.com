+ This paper addresses a well-known problem that occurs when memories are exposed to radiation: the determination if a bit flip 
+ is isolated or if it belongs to a multiple event. As it is unusual to know the physical layout of the memory, this paper 
+ proposes to evaluate the statistical properties of the sets of corrupted addresses and to compare the results with a 
+ mathematical prediction model where all of the events are single bit upsets. A set of rules easy to implement in common 
+ programming languages can be iteratively applied if anomalies are observed, thus yielding a classification of errors quite 
+ closer to reality (more than 80% accuracy in our experiments).
